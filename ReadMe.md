* Part A - Foundations 4.4
* Part B - Foundations Practice
* Part C - Challenge


## Part A

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `labs.partA` look at the file `FlipCoin`.

#### Step 02

* Examine FlipCoin.java:
  * Execute the following program and observe the random
  number that chance generated
  * If chance < 0.5, record the result as "heads"; else record the
  result as "tails"
  * Repeat this many times

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `labs.partA` look at the file `RockPaperScissor` 

#### Step 02

* Examine RockPaperScissor.java
  * Perform the following:
    * Simulate the RockPaperScissor game by generating a random
    integer number in the range of 0 to 3
    * Compare the generated number with the following numbers:
    * if number=0 : "rock"
    * if number=1: "paper"
    * if number=2: "scissors"
    * Record the result and repeat many times

## Part B

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `labs.partB` look at the file `MathSquareRootExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.partB` complete the `Radius` per the following:

    Ask a user to enter the radius, save this input accordingly as the radius
    Create a variable called area that calculates the area using the user's input for the radius (HINT: use a formula)
    Print to the console "The area of circle is: " and the variable area

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Enter the radius: 25
The area of circle is: 1963.25
```

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `labs.partB.ex02` look at the file `MinimumExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.partB.ex02` complete the `Maximum` per the following:

    Utilize the built in math function to find the maximum between two numbers
    Print out this result

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Maximum number of 12 and 20 is: 20
```

> Use MinimumExample for reference.

### Exercise 03

#### Step 01

In the package `labs.partB.ex02` look at the file `MinimumExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.partB.ex03` complete the `AbsoluteValue` per the following:

    Sum the pre defined variables inside of the class
    Utilizing the built in absolute value method, print out the absolute value of the sum

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
225
```

> Use MinimumExample for reference.



### Part C

In the package `labs.partC` complete `KeypadConversion`, the objective of your program should be to ask a user for a message and display that message as a series of key presses on a telephone keypad, seen here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad)

Ex1: Input = b then output = 22

Ex2: Input = y then output = 999

Ex3: Input = abc then output = 222222
