* Part A - Foundations 4.4
* Part B - Foundations 4.5
* Part C - Challenge


## Part A

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partA` look at the file `FlipCoin`.

#### Step 02

* Examine FlipCoin.java:
  * Execute the following program and observe the random
  number that chance generated
  * If chance < 0.5, record the result as "heads"; else record the
  result as "tails"
  * Repeat this many times

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partA` look at the file `RockPaperScissor` 

#### Step 02

* Examine RockPaperScissor.java
  * Perform the following:
    * Simulate the RockPaperScissor game by generating a random
    integer number in the range of 0 to 3
    * Compare the generated number with the following numbers:
    * if number=0 : "rock"
    * if number=1: "paper"
    * if number=2: "scissors"
    * Record the result and repeat many times

### Part B
### Exercise 01

* A personâ€™s body mass index (BMI) is computed
like this: BMI = weight/height^2 X 703

#### Step 01

In the package `partB` look at the file `ComputeBMI`.

#### Step 02

 * Write a program that computes the BMI and rounds off the BMI
 * Use the methods of the Math class and display
   the output as:
   * Enter the weight in pounds: 132.5
   * Enter the height in inches: 62.5
   * Your Body Mass Index is 24


### Part C

In this part of the lab you will complete `KeypadConversion`, the objective of your program should be to ask a user for a message and display that message as a series of key presses on a telephone keypad, seen here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad)

Ex1: Input = b then output = 22

Ex2: Input = y then output = 999

Ex3: Input = abc then output = 222222
